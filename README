Photo mosaic - Native js ES6
------------

1. A user selects a local image file.
2. The app loads that image, divides the image into tiles, computes the average
   color of each tile, fetches a tile from the server for that color, and
   composites the results into a photomosaic of the original image.
3. The composited photomosaic is displayed according to the following
   constraints:
    - tiles should be rendered a complete row at a time (a user should never
      see a row with some completed tiles and some incomplete)
    - the mosaic should be rendered from the top row to the bottom row.
4. The client app makes effective use of parallelism and asynchrony.

To start it, run npm start.


Core files:
  /              serves mosaic.html
  /js/*          serves static resources
  /color/<hex>   serves an SVG mosaic tile for color <hex>.  e.g., /color/0e4daa

The tile size is configurable via the code constants in js/mosaic.js.
